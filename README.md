# Safe and Accelerated Reinforcement Learning for Radio Resource Management (SARL-RRM)

This project is part of my PhD thesis. I use the problem of resource allocation in Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing to demonstrate the need, and potential approaches for safe and accelerated DRL-based RRM. The related publication are listed in a separate section below and will be continuosly updated.
